    "### **1. Understand the Paper's Model Components**\n",
    "The paper describes a hierarchical control model with the following components:\n",
    "- **Spinal Reflex Pathway**: Includes stretch reflex dynamics (already implemented in your model).\n",
    "- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Represent cortical feedback pathways (sensory and motor cortices).\n",
    "- **Musculoskeletal Model**: A two-segment planar arm with six muscles (monoarticular and biarticular).\n",
    "- **Proprioceptive Feedback**: Includes joint angles, velocities, and muscle states.\n",
    "- **Training Objective**: Optimize the RNN to minimize energy consumption and kinematic error during a posture perturbation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Plan the Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1: Extend the Musculoskeletal Model**\n",
    "- Replace the single-joint model with a **two-segment planar arm**.\n",
    "  - **Segments**: Humerus and forearm.\n",
    "  - **Joints**: Shoulder and elbow.\n",
    "  - **Muscles**: Four monoarticular (shoulder flexor/extensor, elbow flexor/extensor) and two biarticular (biceps and triceps).\n",
    "- Implement muscle kinematics:\n",
    "  - Muscle lengths and velocities depend on joint angles and moment arms.\n",
    "  - Use the equations provided in the paper for muscle length and velocity.\n",
    "- Add muscle force dynamics:\n",
    "  - Include force-length and force-velocity relationships for each muscle.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2: Add the RNN Controller**\n",
    "- Implement a **two-layer RNN**:\n",
    "  - **Sensory Layer**: Processes proprioceptive feedback (joint angles, velocities, muscle forces).\n",
    "  - **Motor Layer**: Generates descending commands to muscles.\n",
    "- Define the RNN dynamics:\n",
    "  - Use the discretized neural activation equation provided in the paper.\n",
    "  - Include time constants, biases, and weight matrices for each layer.\n",
    "- Train the RNN:\n",
    "  - Use the Adam optimizer to minimize the composite cost function (energy + kinematic error).\n",
    "  - Define the cost function as described in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3: Integrate Spinal Reflexes**\n",
    "- Combine the RNN output with spinal reflex contributions to compute muscle activation.\n",
    "- Include the **spinal reflex delay** (20 ms) and **afferent encoding**:\n",
    "  - Encode muscle kinematics (length, velocity, acceleration, jerk) into afferent signals.\n",
    "  - Scale the spinal reflex gain for high and low background load conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4: Simulate the Posture Perturbation Task**\n",
    "- Implement the task setup:\n",
    "  - Apply background loads (low and high) to the shoulder and elbow joints.\n",
    "  - Introduce a step perturbation load after a random delay.\n",
    "- Simulate the task:\n",
    "  - Use the Euler integration method with a time step of 10 ms.\n",
    "  - Record joint angles, velocities, muscle activations, and neural activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 5: Analyze and Compare Results**\n",
    "- Compare the simulation results with the experimental data:\n",
    "  - **Muscle EMG**: Verify gain scaling in the spinal reflex response.\n",
    "  - **Neural Activity**: Check for reduced cortical activity in high background load conditions.\n",
    "  - **Kinematics**: Analyze joint displacement and hand trajectories.\n",
    "- Perform PCA on neural activity to visualize trajectories in neural space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Implementation Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Musculoskeletal Model**\n",
    "- Use the Lagrange equation to compute joint torques and motion.\n",
    "- Define the moment arms for each muscle across the shoulder and elbow joints.\n",
    "- Implement the muscle force-length and force-velocity properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **RNN Dynamics**\n",
    "- Define the sensory and motor layers with 200 units each.\n",
    "- Initialize weights and biases randomly.\n",
    "- Use delayed proprioceptive feedback as input to the sensory layer.\n",
    "- Project the motor layer output to the muscle activation layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Training**\n",
    "- Train the RNN using 16 load conditions (8 directions × 2 load sizes).\n",
    "- Use the composite cost function to optimize the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Simulation**\n",
    "- Simulate the task for 3000 ms:\n",
    "  - Background load: 0-1500 ms.\n",
    "  - Perturbation load: 1500-3000 ms.\n",
    "- Record neural and kinematic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Tools and Libraries**\n",
    "- **Python**: Use NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch for numerical computations and RNN training.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib for plotting kinematics, EMG, and neural activity.\n",
    "- **Simulation**: Use `solve_ivp` or a custom Euler integrator for the musculoskeletal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Validation**\n",
    "- Compare your results with the figures in the paper:\n",
    "  - Ensure the spinal reflex gain scaling matches the experimental data.\n",
    "  - Verify the reduction in cortical activity for high background loads.\n",
    "  - Reproduce the neural trajectories using PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Next Steps**\n",
    "- Once the model is validated, explore extensions:\n",
    "  - Test the model with different perturbation profiles.\n",
    "  - Investigate the role of cortical feedback in adapting to novel tasks.\n",
